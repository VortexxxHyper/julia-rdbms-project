# julia-rdbms-project
This repository is part of my bachelor thesis, where I explore the interaction between Julia and various relational database management systems (RDBMS), including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MS Access. This is a work in progress, and updates will be added as the research progresses.
Project Goals:
✅ Explorative Phase: Analyze and compare how these databases handle a fixed Entity-Relationship (ER) model for students and courses.
✅ Implementation Phase: Develop a CRUD loop in Julia to interact with each RDBMS in a consistent way.
